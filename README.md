Data source:
Asthma surveillance data at a national and state level
Across years 
https://www.cdc.gov/asthma/data-visualizations/default.htm

Background: 
Why is asthma important? We are experiencing more extreme weather due to climate change, so asthma prevalence may be increasing 
Hotter summers
More pollen 
Asthma is a comorbidity for chronic disease and worsens status → we saw this with COVID 

Analysis plan:
Correlation analysis 
Asthma correlates with extreme temperatures
with some spatial mapping 
Adding boxplots to show distribution across years → might want to only do this for one specific state with the highest asthma cases?

→ average weather by season 
→ we can integrate the weather data from class to show side by side the extreme weathers

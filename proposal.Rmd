#### Tentative Project Title

Exploring the Link Between Asthma Trends and Climate Change //

#### Motivation 

Extreme weather is on the rise due to climate change, with many, especially those who come from a lower socioeconomic background, already feeling the adverse effects changing weather patterns. In this project, we want to focus specifically on asthma prevalence as hotter temperatures can lead to more pollen, air pollution, and other lung irritants. Asthma is a comorbidity for other chronic diseases and also disproportionately affects those from a lower economic status. Studying these trends will help understand the health risks in vulnerable populations.

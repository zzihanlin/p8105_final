## Welcome!

Our project is focused on exploring the possible adverse health effects that could be associated to global climate change. Specifically, we focused on asthma prevalence as hotter temperatures can lead to more pollen, air pollution, and other lung irritants. Studying these trends will help understand the health risks in vulnerable populations.


## Temperature Trends

Temperature likely plays a role in asthma prevalence, but the strength and nature of the relationship depend on demographic and socioeconomic factors. Disparities among racial/ethnic groups may exist, as indicated by differences in prevalence or interaction effects.

To learn more about the trends, you can navigate through interactive [maps](https://klopez67.shinyapps.io/final_draft/) of asthma prevalence across the US.

## Regression Analysis

After performing regression analysis, we found that temperature has a statistically significant but small effect on asthma prevalence, indicating other factors are likely more important. Although Race/ethnicity is an important factor, the effect of racial/ethnic groups on asthma prevalence varies. Certain groups (e.g., Multirace-NH) have significantly higher prevalence, while others (e.g., Hispanic) have lower prevalence. 

You can access analysis details and results from [here](regression.html).

## Report

Extreme weather is on the rise due to climate change. However, we found for those who come from a lower socioeconomic background, the adverse effects changing weather patterns are especially obvious. We are planning to do researches on the trends of weather by studying asthma prevalence/incidence, and to understand the hidden risks that our populations might face.

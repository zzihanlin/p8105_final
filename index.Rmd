## Welcome!

Our project is focused on exploring the possible adverse health effects that could be associated to global climate change.  Specifically, we focused on asthma prevalence as hotter temperatures can lead to more pollen, air pollution, and other lung irritants. Studying these trends will help understand the health risks in vulnerable populations.


## Temperature Trends

Temperature likely plays a role in asthma prevalence, but the strength and nature of the relationship depend on demographic and socioeconomic factors. Disparities among racial/ethnic groups may exist, as indicated by differences in prevalence or interaction effects.

To learn more about the trends, you can navigate through interactive [maps](https://klopez67.shinyapps.io/final_draft/) of asthma prevalence across the US.

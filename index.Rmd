## Welcome!

Our project is focused on exploring the possible adverse health effects that could be associated to global climate change.  Specifically, we focused on asthma prevalence as hotter temperatures can lead to more pollen, air pollution, and other lung irritants. Studying these trends will help understand the health risks in vulnerable populations.


## Temperature Trends

You can navigate through interactive [maps](https://klopez67.shinyapps.io/final_draft/) of asthma prevalence across the US
